# MXHX Parser

A specialized XML parser for the [MXHX](https://mxhx.dev) markup language that returns a tree of units that represent the syntax, but not the semantics, of the document. Units in the generated result include open tags, close tags, attributes, and text content. Reports errors when the MXHX syntax is invalid, but also supports "repairing" the tree â€” allowing for real-time code intelligence in MXHX tooling, such as editors and IDEs.

A separate library, such as [mxhx-component](https://github.com/mxhx-dev/mxhx-component), is required to assign meaning to each tag, attribute, or block of text.

## Minimum Requirements

- Haxe 4.0

## Installation

This library is not yet available on Haxelib, so you'll need to install it from Github.

```sh
haxelib git mxhx-parser https://github.com/mxhx-dev/mxhx-parser.git
```

## Project Configuration

After installing the library above, add it to your Haxe _.hxml_ file.

```hxml
--library mxhx-parser
```

For Lime and OpenFL, add it to your _project.xml_ file.

```xml
<haxelib name="mxhx-parser" />
```
